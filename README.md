The purpose of this project is to wrangle data from WeRateDogs Twitter account. First, data is going to be obtained
from multiple sources. Next, it is going to be assessed in terms of both [quality and tidiness](https://ryanwingate.com/purpose/tidy-data/ ). Finally, I will clean the data so that it is ready for the analysis.
