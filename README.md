# Wrangle and Analyze Data Project

### This project is part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree

The purpose of this project is to wrangle data about WeRateDogs Twitter account. First, data is going to be obtained
from multiple sources. Next, the data is going to be assessed in terms of both quality and tidines (https://ryanwingate.com/purpose/tidy-data/ ). Finally, I will clean the data and perform simple analysis.
